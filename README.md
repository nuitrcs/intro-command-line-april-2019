# Command Line - Introduction Workshop

# Prep

## Software

Mac users don't need to install anything.  Windows users, install a [Bash Shell](https://workshops.rcs.northwestern.edu/install/bash/) before the workshop.  

## Files

In addition to the software above, you also need to download a .zip file with material we'll be using in the workshop.  

[Download](https://github.com/nuitrcs/bash_hpc_workshops/blob/master/shell-novice-data.zip?raw=true)

Unzip this file and move the unzipped folder to your desktop.

For reference during the workshop, the workshop mostly follows [Software Carpentry: An Introduction to the Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), although there are parts we skip.
